  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 02/18/2026</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Your App Name (“the App”) handles information.</p>

  <h2>2. Personal Data</h2>
  <p>The App does not require account registration and does not collect personal information such as name, email address, or contact details.</p>

  <h2>3. Local Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All user-generated data is stored locally on the user’s device. The developer does not have access to this data.</p>

  <h2>4. Face ID / Device Authentication</h2>
  <p>The App may optionally use Apple Face ID or device authentication to restrict access. Biometric data is processed solely by Apple on the device and is never collected, stored, or transmitted by the App.</p>

  <h2>5. Crash Reporting and Diagnostics</h2>
  <p>The App uses Firebase Crashlytics, a service provided by Google, to collect anonymous crash reports and diagnostic information in order to improve app stability and performance.</p>
  <p>This information may include device type, operating system version, and crash logs. No personally identifiable information is collected through this process.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>The App does not sell, rent, or share personal data with third parties. Anonymous diagnostic data may be processed by Firebase Crashlytics in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. The App does not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>

  <h2>8. Future Features</h2>
  <p>The App may introduce optional in-app purchases in the future. If implemented, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.</p>

  <h2>9. Security</h2>
  <p>Since user data is stored locally on the device, users are responsible for securing their device. The developer implements reasonable safeguards within the App.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page.</p>
